Things to do:

Firstly, allow users to create and login to their account.

Do some research: Flask vs Apache? Similarities/differences? Is Flask
actually used in industry or is it mainly Apache?

Where I left off 10/17:
Got all of the login and accounts stuff working.
Figured out how to store the users id as session variable.
Need to figure out how that session variable will be useful.
