There should be no raw html files being served.
Things to do:

Firstly, allow users to create and login to their account.

Left off Saturday night:
Got "create account" form to write username/password to db.
Next: need to do some sort of check to make sure username isn't already
taken when creating account.
Do some research: Flask vs Apache? Similarities/differences? Is Flask
actually used in industry or is it mainly Apache?
